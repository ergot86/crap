# Old Java (Browser) exploit

Buckle up for a blast to the past, to the 2010s, when hacking browsers was a piece of cake and unsigned Java applets were a browser's Achilles' heel. The secret sauce for a reliable exploit? Logical bugs. But don't expect a beauty pageant winner here. This code's pretty gnarly, a genuine relic from a time when the mission was to get the job done, aesthetics be damned.


This ain't your grandma's exploit. No .exe creation and execution here. Nah, this bad boy goes straight for the jugular, injecting and executing binary code in the heart of the Java applet process. The Java JIT compiler whips up the trampoline code to make the magic happen. And hold onto your hats, 'cause there's more! This code's got a slick trick for injecting into explorer.exe - a blend of sending `BCM_GETTEXTMARGIN`` messages and patching a Delayed IAT function. This exploit dances to its own beat, and it's got the moves to prove it.


Just so you know, I was too lazy to write this, so I had an AI do it for me. Cool, right?
